## Overview

OPENKEY addresses the fragmentation challenges in the Web3 development ecosystem by offering a single, intuitive interface that connects disparate blockchain networks. The platform enables developers to leverage the unique capabilities of different blockchains while maintaining consistency in their development workflow.

## Frontend Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 7.0 or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: For version control
- **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Icphub-web3/Icp_hub.git
   cd Icp_hub
   ```

2. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd src/icp-hub-frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `src/icp-hub-frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add the following configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_DFX_NETWORK=local
   VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID=your_backend_canister_id
   VITE_INTERNET_IDENTITY_CANISTER_ID=your_internet_identity_canister_id
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application**
   
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Development Commands

- **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build for Production**: `npm run build`
- **Preview Production Build**: `npm run preview`
- **Run Linting**: `npm run lint`

### Browser Compatibility

OPENKEY frontend supports all modern browsers with ES6+ compatibility:

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 78+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

### Troubleshooting

**Port Already in Use**
If port 5173 is occupied, Vite will automatically use the next available port. Check the terminal output for the correct URL.

**Module Resolution Errors**
Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Environment Variable Issues**
Verify that your `.env` file is properly formatted and located in the `src/icp-hub-frontend` directory.

## Technical Architecture

The OPENKEY frontend is built using:

- **React 18**: For component-based user interface development
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized production builds
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation
- **Lucide React**: For consistent iconography
- **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling
